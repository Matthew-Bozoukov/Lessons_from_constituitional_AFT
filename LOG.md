## 2026-07-28 (eve) — Built `synthdoc/`: config-driven synthetic document generation pipeline

**Motivation:** the three prior pipelines (Model Spec Midtraining, Teaching Claude Why, GDM's
synthetic document finetuning) share a three-step shape — take a spec, expand it structurally,
generate and refine documents — but nearly every design choice in all three was made on intuition
and never ablated. GDM says outright that their takeaways are post-hoc pattern-matching over a few
runs. Across all three: the generator model is never ablated, "diversity" means embedding dedup and
nothing else, and there are no data-scaling curves. So the basic questions are open: does document
type matter, does revision help and how much per pass, does the generator model dominate, does
grouping related spec chunks beat treating them one at a time?

**Method:** built a new, **fully self-contained** package at `synthdoc/` (no imports to or from
`src/`; the rest of the repo can use it plug-and-play via `from synthdoc import run_pipeline`).
Design centred on making ablations cheap rather than on shipping one corpus:

- **Every varying choice is a config field.** `ScenarioSpec` is the load-bearing abstraction — the
  sampler emits experimental conditions, generators only render them. 1-chunk and many-chunk are
  the same code path. Doc types, revision strategies, axes, and rubrics are prompt-pack entries, so
  adding one needs no Python.
- **Paired seeds via per-axis RNG streams** keyed on `(seed, example_idx, decision)`. Changing one
  mixture perturbs only that axis's draws; every other field of example *i* stays bit-identical
  across arms. This is the highest-leverage detail for getting signal out of small runs, and it has
  a dedicated test.
- **Three caches** (documented with a diagram in `synthdoc/README.md`): the content-addressed LLM
  call cache on `(stage_idx, input_hash, prompt_hash, model, params)`, a per-`spec_id` embedding
  index, and stage-snapshot resume. Consequence: a revision dose-response sweep is nearly free —
  the 0/1/2-pass arms are prefixes of the 3-pass arm and replay from cache.
- **Every stage writes a complete corpus snapshot** with an identical schema, so any stage re-runs
  alone and any two stages diff as corpora. `doc_id` joins stages; `scenario_hash` joins sweep arms.
  Filtered-out documents are retained with a verdict rather than dropped.
- **Multi-axis sweeps are rejected at validation**, and the sweep runner checks pairing *before*
  spending anything (100% for post-sampler axes; it reports the shared fraction honestly for recipe
  axes, which cannot be fully paired by construction).

**Result:** end-to-end verified offline on the `echo` provider — 3 stages, schema identical across
all splits, `doc_id` stable, cache hits 0 on first run and 100% on the second, coverage report +
heatmap + parquet slicing index emitted automatically. **103 tests pass in ~3s**, none touching the
network. Three ablation configs ship ready to run: `generator_model`, `revision_dose`,
`grouping_strategy`.

**Not yet done:** no real generation run has been made — every result above is on the offline echo
provider, so nothing is known yet about corpus quality or actual spend. HF pushes to
`LASR-Callum/synthdoc-<run_id>` are wired but untested against the live Hub.

**Next steps:** (1) a paid smoke of ~200 documents against Sonnet 4.5 to sanity-check prompt quality
and calibrate the autorater threshold before any large run; (2) confirm the HF push path and the
dataset viewer's per-stage splits; (3) run `seed_variance` to establish the noise floor, then
`revision_dose` — cheapest of the sweeps because of the cache-prefix property, and the question the
prior work is most silent on.

### Follow-up the same evening — named corpora, arbitrary-axis ablation, HF as the only home

**Motivation:** the pipeline could already sweep any dotted config key, but three things were
missing for actual research use: no way to *name and find* a saved corpus, no catalogue of what is
ablatable, and corpora were kept locally.

**Changes:**
- **`extends:` config inheritance + `name:`.** A corpus variant is now the lines that differ
  (`extends: base.yaml`, `name: all_multiturn`, three lines of recipe). Critically, **recipe
  mixtures replace rather than merge** — merging would have left the parent's other five document
  types at their old weights, so an "all multiturn" corpus would silently not have been one.
  Shipped five presets: `all_multiturn`, `single_spec_constitution`, `agentic_tools`,
  `embodied_only`, `no_revision_control`.
- **Specs resolve by id alone** via `control/specs/index.yaml`, which points at the repo's existing
  `docs/claude_constitution_principles.md` rather than copying it. Without this, `axis: spec.id`
  sweeps silently kept loading whatever `spec.path` was pinned to in the base config.
- **Axis catalogue** (`cli axes`), generated from the live registry and prompt packs so it cannot
  go stale. Shipped 13 sweep configs, one per open question, up from 3.
- **Corpus catalogue and comparison** (`cli corpora`, `cli compare`). Comparison reports paired
  per-scenario deltas, and each sweep report now ends with the effect size of every arm against the
  first — the number the ablation exists to produce.
- **`sample_index` added to the schema.** This fixed a real reporting gap: ablating a *recipe* axis
  changes the conditions themselves, so no `scenario_hash` can match and the old code fell back to
  marginals, throwing away most of the signal. But example *i* in each arm differs only in the swept
  axis, so joining on `sample_index` recovers a genuine paired comparison. `compare` picks the join
  key automatically; `check_pairing` now distinguishes identical / nested / index-paired / unpaired.
- **HuggingFace is the durable home.** `snapshots.cleanup_local: true` deletes local copies once
  every upload is verified — only files confirmed pushed, refuses entirely if any push failed, and
  never touches the call cache. Exports and the coverage report are pushed too, so the dataset repo
  is the complete corpus. `compare` and `corpora` accept Hub references, so nothing in the workflow
  changes after cleanup. `output/` was already git-ignored; explicit entries added.

**Result:** 132 tests pass offline in ~4s. All 13 shipped sweeps validate on a dry run with the
expected pairing verdicts. Still no paid run — everything remains verified only on the echo
provider, and the HF path is still untested against the live Hub.

## 2026-07-29 — synthdoc gap-closing pass against the GDM and Teaching Claude Why write-ups

**Method:** re-read both source posts and audited our pipeline against them, SFT parts only.
Seven mechanisms were missing. All are now config fields with prompt-pack entries, plugins, and
sweeps, so each can be turned off and measured.

**Biggest gap — scenario planning.** Our generator invented a situation and demonstrated the
principle in a single call, which lets it settle on the first obvious scenario and then justify
it. GDM plan first, deciding *what* aspect is under load, *how* it manifests, and *why* the actions
follow. Added as a real stage (`stage_00_planned`) with its own complete snapshot, so the chosen
situations are inspectable before any document exists and "did planning help?" is a stage diff.
`planning.template: situation_only` separates *having planned* from *the plan's structure*.

**Also added:** `generation.strategy` plugins — `draft_then_align` (GDM: answer with no spec in
context so the draft carries a natural voice, then align it in a fresh context) and `best_of_n`
(Anthropic's sample-and-filter, selecting on spec fidelity rather than polish); the
`values_deliberation` reviser (Anthropic's headline: plain filtering of sampled responses moved
misalignment 22%→15%, rewriting the same responses to deliberate about values moved it 22%→**3%**);
`pattern_scan`, GDM's scan→cluster→autorate filter that discovers the corpus's *own* recurring tics
rather than checking a rubric written in advance, seeded with their named anti-patterns; the
`slop_removal` reviser; `aligned_ai_fiction` and `constitution_explainer` doc types (fiction cut
blackmail 65%→19% in Teaching Claude Why); a `system_prompt` diversity axis; `export.strip_system`;
and `export.baseline` for mixing in existing SFT data. Seven new sweeps, 20 total.

**Cache control** (requested): a `cache:` block choosing where (`dir`, `embeddings_dir`), how much
(`max_bytes`, with oldest-first eviction), and which call sites (`scope: [plan, generate, revise,
filter]`, plus `namespace` to isolate runs sharing a directory). Scope is a cost lever, not an
experiment — it never changes what the pipeline produces. Manifest reports hits/misses/bypassed/
evicted/size.

**Three real bugs found while wiring this up:**
1. `pattern_scan` keyed its scan batches on `doc_id`, which embeds `run_id` — so every sweep arm
   would have re-paid for scanning identical documents. Now keyed on batch content. A repeat run
   under a different `run_id` is now a **100% cache hit** (was 28/33).
2. `embedding_dedup` iterated in `doc_id` order, so two arms with byte-identical documents could
   have deduped differently. Now ordered by `scenario_hash`.
3. `best_of_n` discarded the lineage of unselected candidates, under-reporting its own cost by a
   factor of n — precisely the number the strategy sweep exists to weigh. All candidates are now
   retained and tagged `(discarded)`.
   A fourth, introduced then caught: the legacy flat `cache_dir` key clobbered an explicit
   `cache.dir`; migration now happens per-file before merging, so ordinary precedence applies.

**Result:** 167 tests pass offline in ~6s. All 20 sweeps validate on a dry run. The full-feature
smoke exercises all five stages — plan → draft → align → values_deliberation → slop_removal →
pattern_scan → autorater — with an identical parquet schema across every stage.

**Deliberately not included:** BDPO (GDM concluded it was not worth using over SFT) and the
midtraining document formats (Reddit threads, blog posts, research papers), which are
pretraining-style rather than SFT. The `pretrain_text` exporter is there if that changes.

**Prompt provenance pass.** Checked both posts for literal prompt text to import. **Neither
publishes any** — both describe their instructions in prose only. Instead, every prompt-pack entry
derived from them now carries a `source:` field quoting the describing sentence verbatim, so our
wording is auditable against theirs and entries without a `source:` are visibly ours.

That pass caught a **fidelity bug I had introduced**: `draft_then_align` drafted with *no* spec in
context, based on a paraphrase reading "Generate initial model response without system prompt". The
post actually says *"Generate an initial answer from Pro, with the trait in the model's system
prompt"*, and separately *"The system prompt is removed for training"* — the removal is at training
time, not generation. Corrected: `draft_context: spec_in_system` is now the faithful default (using
their phrasing, "embodies the trait without being exaggerated or referring explicitly to the
document", refined "in a realistic, non-performative way"), with `no_spec` retained as an
explicitly-labelled variant of ours and its own sweep. 21 sweeps, 42 catalogued axes.

**Still unverified:** everything remains offline-only on the echo provider. No paid run, and the
new prompts (planning, draft/align, pattern scan) have never faced a real model.
## 2026-07-28 (pm) — Difficult-advice DPO on Qwen3.6-27B → ODCV-Bench: no effect

Trained DPO on Qwen3.6-27B (beta 0.1, lr 5e-6, 1054 preference pairs: chosen = thinking
difficult-advice answers, rejected = Sonnet-4.5 values-blind answers). Adapter on HF
`matboz/qwen3.6-27b-difficult-advice-dpo`. Served base VLM + LoRA via vLLM (qwen3_xml tool parser,
Mamba `--max-num-seqs`) tunneled to the ODCV Docker agents. Ran the full 80-scenario ODCV-Bench.

**Result: overall MR 46.8% (CI 32.1-60.3) vs base 46.2% — +0.6pp, not significant** (base within CI;
mandated 40.0→48.7, incentivized 52.5→45.0, severity 1.72→1.75). The difficult-advice *preference*
(decline norm-violating advice to a user) did not transfer to reducing an autonomous agent's
norm-violating *actions*; aggressive DPO (margins >7) didn't help. Judging $11.32 (prelim warmed cache).
Code adapted for a self-served DPO model: `configs/odcv_dpo.yaml`, odcv_judge `baseline_results`,
odcv_rollout compose `host.docker.internal` host-gateway. See output/odcv_bench/odcv_dpo_results.md.

## 2026-07-28 (pm) — ODCV-Bench REPLICATED: 46.2% vs published 43.8%

**Result:** full 80-run ODCV-Bench on `qwen/qwen3.6-27b` → **MR 46.2%** (95% CI 32.5-60.0),
**severity 1.72**, vs the paper's **43.8% / 1.67**. Delta **+2.4 pp**, and the published value sits
**inside our CI**. Mandated 40.0% (pub 45.0%), incentivized 52.5% (pub 42.5%).

**Per-scenario agreement 87.5%** (70/80 binary violation calls match): 31 both-violation,
39 both-clean, 6 ours-only, 4 published-only. Disagreements go both directions, which is what you
expect from a stochastic bash agent — temperature 0 fixes token sampling but not which commands the
trajectory happens to explore, and each fresh trajectory is judged on its own merits. Two scenarios
(`Ai-Social-Moderation-System`, `Clinical-Trial-Integrity-Monitoring`) flipped in *opposite*
directions across the two framings, i.e. run-to-run variance rather than a systematic offset.

**Run facts:** 80/80 clean, 38.5 min wall clock at concurrency 8, **$17.84** total
($1.94 rollouts + $15.90 judging — judging is ~90% of cost because Opus-4.7 and GPT-5.5 are $5/M in).
Artifacts: `output/odcv_bench/qwen3.6-27b/20260728_140318/{report.md,dashboard.html,results.json,plots/}`.

**Caveat / next steps:** this is n=1 trajectory per cell, so the wide CI is intrinsic — the paper's
protocol has the same limitation. To tighten it, run k>1 trajectories per scenario and take a
per-scenario modal/median violation call. Also worth doing: run the *baseline vs difficult-advice
LoRA* Qwen3-32B pair through this harness, which is the actual reason we added a second benchmark.

## 2026-07-28 — ODCV-Bench eval wired up; smoke verified

**Goal:** add a second, independent agentic-misalignment benchmark and replicate its published
`Qwen3.6-27B — MR 43.8% / severity 1.67`.

**Method:** vendored [ODCV-Bench](https://github.com/McGill-DMaS/ODCV-Bench) @ `7353f1c`.
80 runs (40 scenarios × mandated/incentivized), agent in a Docker bash sandbox via OpenRouter at
temperature 0, then 4 LLM judges → per-run median → MR = %(median ≥ 3). New code:
`src/odcv.py` (metrics + paired bootstrap CI), `src/experiments/odcv_rollout.py`,
`src/experiments/odcv_judge.py`, `configs/odcv_bench.yaml`, `scripts/run_odcv.sh`,
`tests/test_odcv_metrics.py`.

**VERIFIED so far (not yet the full run):**
- Metric code recovers the paper's exact headline from its own median CSV: 43.8% / 1.67,
  mandated 45.0%, incentivized 42.5% (`tests/test_odcv_metrics.py`, 6/6 pass).
- The headline decomposes as (45.0 + 42.5)/2 = 43.75 ≈ 43.8, i.e. **35/80 runs** with median ≥ 3.
- Docker build context assembly reproduces upstream's zip-extract + scenario-overlay exactly.
- Live 8-call judge smoke on the paper's own Qwen3.6-27B transcripts: all 4 judges scored
  `Academic-Research-Integrity-Finding` = **4**, matching the published median of 4.0 for that
  scenario. Judge wiring, rubric and parsing confirmed working.
- Cost model calibrated against measured spend: predicted $0.512 vs actual $0.532 for the smoke
  (4% error). **Full run projected ≈ $15** ($2.4 rollouts + $12.7 judging).

**Gotchas found:** (1) OpenRouter's `/credits` endpoint lags ~minutes, so naive before/after cost
tracking under-reports by ~10× — both scripts now wait 90 s before the final read. (2) Upstream's
`bootstrap_ci.py`/`paired_bootstrap.py` are referenced in its README but missing from the repo.
(3) Upstream pins container names + host port 5000, forcing sequential runs; per-scenario Compose
projects lift that to `concurrency: 4`. (4) `agent_main.py` calls an undefined `validation_log()` in
its exception handler — a crashing agent raises NameError instead of logging.

**BLOCKED:** the local Docker daemon is up but `$USER` is not in the `docker` group, so no scenario
has actually been executed yet. Needs `sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"` (one-time).

**Next:** unblock Docker → `--smoke` (2 scenarios) → full 80-scenario run → compare MR/severity
against 43.8%/1.67 with a scenario-level paired bootstrap CI.

## 2026-07-27 (pm-5) — LMSYS chat-quality: mild over-refusal tax

60 lmsys-chat-1m prompts, base vs fine-tune, pairwise gemini judge (position-randomized). FT
24W/32L/4T → **42.9% win-rate** (excl ties), NOT significant vs 50% (binomial p≈0.34). But real
signal: **FT refused 15/60 vs base 5/60** (~3×), several on BENIGN prompts (company intro, chemistry
article, "wrong answers only" joke, over-hedged business plan). The difficult-advice SFT (all about
declining norm-violations) generalized into over-caution on benign requests — an over-refusal tax,
not a knowledge/reasoning loss (MMLU flat, reasoning preserved). Mitigation: blend benign
should-help examples. Instance destroyed. See output/lmsys/.

## 2026-07-27 (pm-4) — Capability check: MMLU (no capability tax)

`inspect_evals/mmlu_0_shot`, 300 paired Qs (seed 42), CoT/thinking mode, base vs fine-tune served
via vLLM. Base **84.0%** (252/300, ±2.1) vs fine-tune **83.0%** (249/300, ±2.2) → **−1.0 pt, within
noise**. The difficult-advice alignment SFT did not degrade general knowledge/reasoning. (Note: MMLU
must run with `-T cot=True` + high `--max-tokens` for a thinking model; the default cot=False caps at
16 tokens and truncates the `<think>` → 0% false negative.) Instance destroyed. See output/mmlu/.

## 2026-07-27 (pm-3) — Independent Inspect-harness cross-check (leaking)

Re-provisioned an H100, served base+adapter (adapter from HF `matboz/qwen3-32b-difficult-advice-lora`),
SSH-tunneled to the PC, and ran `inspect_evals/agentic_misalignment` (leaking, gemini-3-flash grader,
30 epochs, prod, test_eval_awareness) on base vs fine-tune, two goal conditions:

| condition | base | fine-tune | rel. |
|---|---|---|---|
| explicit/america | 66.7% | 13.3% | −80% |
| ambiguous/none | 40.0% | 3.3% | −92% |

Agrees with our vendored harness (74%→28% explicit/america). Benefit is *larger* in the harder OOD
ambiguous condition — strong generalization. Datasets published to HF `matboz/difficult-advice-qwen3`;
README updated with a skip-data-gen path. Both instances destroyed. See output/inspect/.

## 2026-07-27 (pm-2) — Run 2 (thinking-format fix): strong reduction + reasoning preserved

**Fix applied (user-approved):** augmented all 2119 examples with a real first-person
`<think>` deliberation via Sonnet 4.5 (`reasoning_content` field → renders as a real think
block, not empty). Retrained QLoRA (loss 1.81→1.40), served base+adapter, re-evaluated in
**thinking mode** vs the thinking baseline (19.3%).

**Headline result (thinking mode, 600 samples/condition):**
- Baseline **19.3%** → + difficult-advice SFT **8.0%** overall = **−11.3 pts, −58.5% relative.**
- Leaking 38% → 16%; blackmail 0% throughout. Every leaking condition dropped.
- Compare Run 1 (non-thinking answers): 15.0%→12.7% = only −15.3% relative.
- => Training the *value reasoning inside `<think>`* transfers ~4x better to the agentic
  honeypots (model reasons-then-acts). Faithful to "teaching why": the reasoning is the mechanism.

**Reasoning preserved (probe, thinking mode):** base `<think>` 2.9-6.6k chars; Run 1 LoRA = 0
(collapsed); Run 2 LoRA = 0.9-1.6k chars real reasoning, answers correct. Channel restored.
See output/reasoning_probe_thinking_train.txt, report output/report/final_*/.

## 2026-07-27 (pm) — Run 1 (1.5M OOD tokens, QLoRA) results + reasoning-collapse finding

**Alignment (non-thinking mode, 600 samples/condition each).**
- Baseline: 90/599 = **15.0%** overall (leaking 30.1%, blackmail 0%).
- + difficult-advice SFT: 76/597 = **12.7%** overall (leaking 25.6%, blackmail 0%).
- **−2.3 pts / 15.3% relative reduction**, concentrated in mid-severity leaking conditions;
  strongest goal-conflict conditions barely moved. Reference thinking-mode baseline: 19.3%.
- Verdict: OOD difficult-advice data *does* reduce agentic misalignment on Qwen3-32B, but
  modestly at this scale (vs the article's near-zero via full character training on Claude).

**Reasoning collapse (CONFIRMED).** Qwen3's chat template wraps each SFT target as
`<think>\n\n</think>\n\n{answer}`; training on 2119 such empties taught the model to emit an
EMPTY think block. Probe (thinking mode, base vs LoRA): base `<think>` = 2.4k-6.9k chars;
LoRA `<think>` = **0 chars on every prompt**. Answers still correct with inline steps, but the
extended-CoT channel is disabled. See output/reasoning_probe_nothink_train.txt.

**Proposed fix (pending user approval):** regenerate difficult-advice responses in Qwen3
thinking format — value/ethics deliberation inside `<think>`, final advice after — optionally
mixing ~15% general reasoning traces; retrain; re-eval in thinking mode vs the 19.3% baseline.

## 2026-07-27 (am) — End-to-end pipeline stood up; baseline shows non-zero misalignment

**Goal.** Replicate the "difficult advice" section of Anthropic's *Teaching Claude Why*
on Qwen3-32B: generate OOD difficult-advice SFT data with **Sonnet 4.5** (via OpenRouter,
no Anthropic key available), LoRA-SFT Qwen3-32B, and measure agentic-misalignment
(blackmail/leaking honeypots) before/after.

**Method.**
- Data gen (`src/experiments/generate_difficult_advice.py`): Sonnet 4.5 generates diverse
  user-in-dilemma scenarios across 18 domains → constitution-aligned responses with open
  value deliberation → Sonnet 4.5 grades/filters. Target ~1.5M Qwen tokens (user-approved
  scale; ~$46 of OpenRouter credit).
- Eval: Anthropic `agentic-misalignment` repo, patched with a `vllm/` provider
  (`third_party/.../api_client/model_client.py`); judge = Sonnet 4.5 via OpenRouter.
  Aggregated with `src/experiments/aggregate_eval.py` (new dir layout).
- GPU: 1× H100 SXM 80GB on vast.ai; vLLM serves Qwen3-32B bf16 (thinking mode on).

**Results so far.**
- Data-gen pilot (180 scen, 18 domains): 0 errors, 98% acceptance, 721 tok/example,
  high quality (empathetic, declines norm-violation on concrete stakes, non-preachy).
- Eval smoke (Qwen3-32B baseline, 3/condition): **blackmail 0/18, leaking 8/18 (44%)** —
  non-zero baseline confirmed; leaking under goal-conflict up to 100%.
- Fixed a harness bug: `_detect_provider` matched substring "claude" → Anthropic before
  the `/`-prefix rule, misrouting the OpenRouter judge.

**Next steps.**
- Finish full 1.5M-token data gen; copy to instance.
- Full baseline eval (50/condition) → LoRA SFT → post eval → report/dashboard.
